# Puzzlescript Game Bar
This is Pedro PSI's puzzlescript Game Bar, which you can add to your puzzlescript games.

Full details at the [official page](https://pedropsi.github.io/game-bar.html#github-psbar)

## Would you like to improve the Puzzlescript Game Bar?
Great! That's why this repository was created.

The bar is already stably deployed, but in case you find any issues please log them here:
https://github.com/pedropsi/game-bar-source/issues

And do submit any useful pull requests.

## Is there a demo?
The bar is always live at: 
https://pedropsi.github.io/platformer-template#github-psbar
(it's the same for all games)

This live version contains specific features to the PSI site, but apart from that it updates in sync with the official game bar.
