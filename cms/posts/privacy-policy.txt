<p>The «SITE-NAME» does not collect <em>personal data</em> as defined in «A-GDPR-A4», except when you <b>you explicitly choose</b> to communicate it, in which case «A-GDPR» will be <b>respected</b>.<p>
<p>Moreover, the «SITE-NAME» is designed to minimise privacy risks. <b>Here's how!</b></p>

<h2>Open-source</h2>
<p>The «SITE-NAME» is <b>open-source</b>. Do <a href="«SOURCE-URL»" «BLANK»>look at the code</a> and if you find any privacy breach or concern, «CONTACT-TEXT-3».</p>

<h2>Transparent</h2>
<p>Here's the list of third parties the «SITE-NAME» infrastructure relies on. Their respective privacy policies apply to the extent that they are relied on.</p>

<h3><em>Github Pages (Microsoft)</em></h3>
<p>This site is hosted on <em>Github Pages</em>, owned by <em>Microsoft</em>.</p>

<h3><em>Google</em></h3>
<p>Some site features (form and feedback submission, analytics) are managed by the «SITE-NAME»'s associated <em>Google</em> account:</p>

<h2>Private Communication</h2>
<p>When you communicate with the «SITE-NAME», for instance by email or form submission, this communication is kept <b>private</b>.  
However, it flows through a <em>Google</em> mailbox and drive so it may stay there for archival purposes as long as «SITE-NAME» runs.</p>

<h2>Email subscriptions</h2>
<p>The same provisions apply as for <b>private communication</b>. Plus, if you subscribe for «SITE-NAME» emails, the use of your adress or any other provided personal data will be restricted to that purpose. All such data is deletable by request, such as when you cancel a subscription.</p> 


<h2>Minimal analytics</h2>

<h2><b>Localsave</b> cookies</h2>
<p>Each game on the «SITE-NAME» offers the <b>Localsave</b> option, which saves your progress across sessions using up to 3 cookies per game. Conveniently, <b>Localsave</b> is on by default (as stated in each game). However, those <b>cookies can be deleted simply</b> by deselecting the save icon (floppy disk).</p>
