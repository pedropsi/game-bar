<h2>FAQ</h2>

<h3>Does the Puzzlescript Game Tagger work on puzzlescript games hosted in itch.io?</h3>
<p>Not yet, sorry!</p>

<h3>Will this be the longest list of puzzlescript games in the world or is there more to it?</h3>
<p>At the moment it is just a long collaborative list, but at some point it will be converted to some sort of wiki, so people can add more information to each game, like the release year and tags! This in turn will allow some filtering functionality.</p>
