<h2>F.A.Q.</h2>
<h3>How was the name Hastefulll chosen?</h3>
<p>Hastefulll is a combination of the words <b>Haste</b> and <b>full</b>, in line with the main game goal: filling the entire board as quickly as possible (in the fewest tries).
It is also a misspelled form of the adjective <b>hasteful</b>, an ill-thought-out substitute for the word <b>hasty</b>... hinting at the theme of lack of time.</p>
