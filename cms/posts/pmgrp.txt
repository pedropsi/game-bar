<h2>F.A.Q.</h2>
<h3>How was the name PMGRP chosen?</h3>
<p>Play Mini Gemini Replay PMGRP is a <em>Recursive Acronym</em>, as the last P in PMGRP refers to the game itself. This results in an infinite name that means play again and again, forever.</p>
<p>It also contains <em>imperfect symmetry</em>, as highlighted: <em>Play</em> <b>Mini</b> Ge-<b>Mini</b> Re-<em>Play</em>. This reflects the slight differences during <em>replay mode</em> due to interactions between the player and its future self.</p>

<h2>Changelog</h2>
<h3>05/2018</h3>
<p>Redesign of <em>level 0</em>; layout changes to <em>levels 6 and 7</em>; improvements in <b>replay mode</b> (highlighting, slowing down); future and present self no longer swap colours.</p>
<h3>06/2018</h3>
<p>Aesthetical changes (including a redesign of respawn and goal animations);  improvement of multi-crate pile physics and dropping; suppression of <em>level 11</em>; all level numbers incremented by 1.</p>
