<h2>«TITLE-BOLD»</h2>
<p>This aims to be the definitive list of all (public) puzzlescript games, ever made, worldwide. Even the terrible ones qualify!</p>
<p>Whenever a new puzzlescript game is made, it will be added to this list by the community. <b>Found a missing title? Please add it now!</b></p>

<h2>Adding a puzzlescript game to this list</h2>
<p>To add a game to the "«TITLE-BOLD»" list in one click, simply use this handy <a href="javascript:
var jsCode=document.createElement('script');
jsCode.setAttribute('src','https://pedropsi.github.io/codes/game/puzzlescript-tagger.js');
jsCode.setAttribute('type','text/javascript');
document.body.appendChild(jsCode);
console.log('Bookmarklet run!');void 0">Submit PuzzleScript Game</a> bookmarklet!</p>

<p> How? Simply add the bookmarklet above to your bookmarks (instructions below), then on a game page of your choice run (click on) the new bookmarklet, causing the current game to add itself the «TITLE-BOLD» page.</p>

<h3>In Chrome</h3>
<p><kbd>Drag</kbd> the above bookmarklet link to your bookmarks toolbar.</p>
<h3>In Firefox</h3>
<p><kbd>Right click</kbd> on the above bookmarklet link, then select "bookmark this link".</p>
<h3>If nothing else works</h3>
<p>Replace the content of an old bookmark with the above link content. Or you could run the bookmarklet js code directly in a game page (it'd still quicker than manually adding a game).</p>


<h2>FAQ</h2>
<h3>Why would you want to contribute to this database for free?</h3>
<p>If you love (puzzlescript) games you'll love to have a definite public list with all titles. Did you know there's more than <span id="titlenumber" class="updatable">1095</span>, and counting?</p>

<script>
window.addEventListener(
	'updated-puzzlescript-games-database-area',
	function(){
		ReplaceChildren(TableLength('puzzlescript-games-database-area'),'titlenumber')
	}
)
</script>

<h3>How could such a huge list of puzzlescript games be compiled almost overnight?</h3>
<p>The bookmarklet is that quick and convenient!</p>

<h3>Is there any shorter, curated list with just the great titles?</h3>
<p>You may be looking for «NAME»'s curated list of «A-SELECTED-GAMES»!</p>

<h3>Is this database safe?</h3>
<p>All submitted games are listed. If a newly submitted game belongs to a known domain (e.g. puzzlescript.net), its link becomes immediately available. Otherwise, it will be listed without a link (so people can google it themselves), until a periodic review. During the review, legitimate new domains will be added to the whitelist and their links enabled, whereas suspicious submissions will be removed.</p>

<h3>How is this database sorted?</h3>
<p>Simply click the table headers to sort the table freely!</p>
<p>By default, most games are sorted alphabetically by author and then by title. New submissions (since the last periodic review) will be displayed on top, unsorted. Usually these will be newly released games, but they may also include elusive old titles.</p>

<h3>How could this long list of puzzlescript games become more useful?</h3>
<p>Depending on traction, this collaborative list may gain a wiki-like character, so people could add detailed info like release year and tags, thus enabling better filtering. If pictures were added, this could become a puzzlescript gallery. Perhaps people would like to vote on their favourites!</p>

<h3>Can this database be used in external projects?</h3>
<p>For non-profit or educational projects, yes, as long as you cite it properly.</p>
