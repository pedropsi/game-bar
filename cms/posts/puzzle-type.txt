«HOWTO-TEXT»
<p>The screen displays only one word. Your goal is to type this word exactly as shown. However, your keyboard is behaving cryptically...  and the word is also your only clue!</p>
<p>You may type any of the 26 uppercase letters of the latin alphabet, and undo by pressing <kbd>backspace</kbd> or <kbd>delete</kbd>. As a rule, other characters or spaces may not be typed, unless the clue suggests otherwise.</p>
<p>All puzzles can be solved with logic, experimentation and creative thinking, perhaps even a search engine or pencil and paper. Solving a puzzle usually requires two steps: discovering which rules are in place, then using these rules to write the clue. Rules don't change nor ever rely on timing, so relax and take your time!</p>
<p>Sometimes, characters may be coloured with a lighter tone. This is just a visual indication for temporary characters, which may be trasformed when certain conditions be (or fail to be) met.</p>
<p>Most levels do not require english proficiency, but the common knowledge demanded by a few of the final levels had unfortunately to be expressed in words of a particular language. Non-native speakers, you can find these english words online easily!</p>
<p>After beating certain puzzles, some people will enjoy replaying them, trying to push the rules to their limits or using the interface as a learning device. All levels were designed with this possibility in mind.</p>

<ul>
<li>Making a compelling enigma with a minimal interface or decoration. «L-DONE»</li>
