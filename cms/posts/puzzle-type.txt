«HOWTO-TEXT»
<p>The screen displays only one word. Your goal is to type this word exactly as shown. However, your keyboard is behaving cryptically...  and the word is also your only clue!</p>
<p>You may type any of the 26 uppercase letters of the latin alphabet, and undo by pressing <kbd>backspace</kbd> or <kbd>delete</kbd>. As a rule, other characters or spaces cannot be typed, unless the clue suggests otherwise.</p>
<p> Sometimes, characters may be coloured with a lighter tone. This is just a visual indication for temporary characters, which may be trasformed when certain conditions be (or fail to be) met.</p>
<p>All puzzles can be solved with logic, experimentation and creative thinking, perhaps even a search engine or pencil and paper. Quick reactions never necessary - relax and take your time.</p>
<p>Most levels do not require english proficiency, but the common knowledge demanded by a few of the final levels had unfortunately to be expressed in words of a particular language. Non-native speakers, you can find these english words online easily!</p>
