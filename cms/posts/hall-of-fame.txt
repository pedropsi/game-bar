<h2>About the «TITLE»</h2>
«ONE-LINER»

<h3>How hard is it to enter the «TITLE»?</h3>
<p>As of June 2018 only about 10% of players manage to finish a game. Moreover, no one has yet solved all the puzzles!  
Therefore, you are officially allowed to brag to your friends about your victories. Most puzzlers, however, follow the humble path and decide not to be listed.</p>

<h3>Are records permanent?</h3>
<p>Yes, for as long as the «SITE-NAME» is live. Shall you want to remove or change your alias, please «CONTACT-TEXT-2».</p>

<h3>You beat a puzzle but you can't find your record. Why?</h3>
<p>Most likely you have found a bug. If you solved a puzzle before «DATE», record-keeping hadn't yet begun. In either case, please «CONTACT-TEXT-1» to fix the situation and recover your glory!</p>
<p>Any impolite aliases will be removed at discretion, without notice.</p>

<h3>How can you prove that a (missing) record relates to you?</h3>
<p>Just provide the date and (approximate) time when you solved the puzzle, plus your strategy for the last level.</p>
