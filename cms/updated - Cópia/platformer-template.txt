<h3>Special thanks</h3>
<p>««P-PRE»HUNKYDORY«P-POS»» and ««P-PRE»ZABEL«P-POS»» for spotting two rare yet important bugs.</p>
<p>««P-PRE»MINOTALEN«P-POS»» for suggesting the addition of hints and for several hint suggestions and improvements.</p>

<h2>F.A.Q.</h2>
<h3>Is «TITLE-BOLD» a real game or a game template?</h3>
<p>Both! Because there is no better way to teach that to put the principles in practice, immediately. Questions like: <em>Why was this level not introduced before?</em> or <em>What is new in this level?</em> or <em>Could any element be removed while preserving the desired effect?</em> should guide your attention while playing.</p>

<h3>Is «TITLE-BOLD» «NAME»'s last game?</h3>
<p>«NAME» intended to close <a href="2019-04-14-a-game-making-journey.html">2018's cycle of puzzlescript games</a> by teaching others - «TITLE-BOLD» emerged naturally from this intention.</p>

<h3>How is beating «TITLE-BOLD»'s an achievement?</h3>
<p>It takes on average 4 enjoyable hours to solve all levels in «TITLE-BOLD», but only 4% of all players so far qualified for the «HOF».</p>

<h3>Does the high difficulty prevent «TITLE-BOLD»'s teaching goals?</h3>
<p>Since all levels are accessible via the level selector, all players regardless of ability can follow every lesson.</p>
