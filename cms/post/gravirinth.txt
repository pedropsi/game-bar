«ABOUT-TEXT»

<p>According to legend, a forgotten civilization once mastered the power of gravity, which they used to travel across the Milky Way, in search for alien life. 
Eager at first to share their wisdom, soon they became aware that most alien life forms were not ready to receive this great power...</p>
<p>So an enigma was devised to test the intelligence of alien societies, a puzzle marvelous yet so obscure that finding it would be a challenge in the first place. Thus the «TITLE-BOLD» were born, each hidden into the most promising solar systems.</p> 
<p>In the next millenia, few «TITLE-BOLD» were ever found, and even fewer yielded their secrets, a rare moment of great joy where two civilisations found they were not alone in the vast cosmos. In the Solar System too had once a «TITLE-BOLD» been found, but its location was lost to mankind...</p>

<p><b>...until Xeno, the Exoarcheologist, arrived.</b> Will the «TITLE-BOLD» reveal its mysteries?</p>
</p>

<h2>F.A.Q.</h2>
<h3>What does the name <em>Gravirinth</em> mean?</h3>
<p><em>Gravirinth</em> is a combination of the words <em>Gravity</em> and <em>Labyrinth</em>. It was coined by <b>base</b> when discussing with <b>Xeno</b> whether to greenlight the expedition, once the strange gravitic signatures were detected. The original alien name is unknown.</p>

<h3>What games inspired «TITLE-BOLD»?</h3>
<p>The game mechanic emerged naturally, drawing elements from <a href="pmgrp.html">Play Mini Gemini Replay</a> (basic platform mechanics),  <a href="whirlpuzzle.html">Whirpuzzle</a> (idea of rotation and space theme) and <a href="tiaradventur.html">Tiaradventur</a> (inventory, narrative system, management of a large word map), whose source codes are openly available.</p>
<p>Specific gravity is also a central theme of the game <a href="https://manifold.garden/" «BLANK»>Manifold Garden</a>.</p>

<h3>How is «TITLE-BOLD» ambitious from a coding point of view?</h3>
<p>The features below make a great game experience and are a puzzlescript coding challenge:</p>
<ul>
	<li>a large animated world map;</li>
	<li>a camera directing system;</li>
	<li>a message selector, for storytelling and strategic hint placement;</li>
	<li>a smart action counter;</li>
	<li>an inventory/dialogue display banners trailing along with the field of view;</li>
	<li>a progressive reveal of unseen areas.</li>
</ul>
