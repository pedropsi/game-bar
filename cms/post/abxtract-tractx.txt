<h2>F.A.Q.</h2>
<h3>What does the name «TITLE:Load» mean?</h3>
<p><em>Abstract Tracts</em> refers both to the vast canvas areas (tracts) to become abstract art, and to the colourful lines (also tracts) connecting different areas in each painting. The <b>S</b>s were replaced by <b>X</b>s to represent the intercrossing of paint lines - so often a byproduct of the game mechanics.</p>

<h3>Why is «TITLE:Load» so unusual a game?</h3>
<p>Because:</p>
<ol>
<li> its main purpose is to <b>spark curiosity for abstract art and classical culture</b> in an entertaining way;</li>
<li> it draws extensively from the <b>history of art</b> rather than from a purpose-made fictional world;</li>
<li> its original mechanics are <b>simple yet difficult to master</b> and</li>
<li> it belongs to the very rare <b>art puzzle</b> computer game genre.</li>
</ol>

<h3> Which criteria guided the choice of artists and artworks?</h3>
<p> The most important criterion for inclusion was the availability of at least one <b>public domain</b> artwork (per artist) that would broadly fit in the abstract category (e.g. Neoplasticism, Suprematism, Abstract Expressionism...). Critically, each artwork had to make <b>a good puzzle</b>, so those with very complicated details or too many colours were excluded. Also, due to the game mechanic and low resolution, right angles were preferred to obliques, and no curvature could be added. So, for instance, Rothko, Pollock, O'Keefe, Delaunay or Kandinsky couldn't be included.</p>

<h3> Why are there differences between the original artwork and its depiction in «TITLE:Load»?</h3>
<p> Most differences arise from the low-game resolution and by the limited colour palette (common to all paintings, chosen for simplicity). Canvas size was limited so it wouldn't be tedious to traverse by the player. Also, brush strokes and other tridimensional paint features were not considered.</p>

<p>Shortening of canvas size in <em>level 5</em>; improvements to colour contrast.</p>
