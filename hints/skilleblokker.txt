level 1 -----------------------------------(this is a hint group, composed of three hints, one per line)
Slide with the <kbd>arrow keys</kbd>.
Your goal is to split the blocks.
Try first pushing both blocks against a wall!

level 2 -----------------------------------(this is another hint group, with just 2 hints)
Every block pair must be split.
Sometimes, to move one step forward, you must first move backwards.
 


level 3 -----------------------------------(this hint group is separated from the previous one by more than one empty line)
Don't let the apparent chaos startle you, focus on the longer blocks instead.
First, move the rightmost longer block down.
The rest is up to you!
 
level 4 -----------------------------------
Keep the central square intact for as long as you can!

level 5 -----------------------------------(all numbers at the start of each hint line, below, are ignored)
4 The smaller blocks will be trapped...
3 ... so where else do you place the U-shaped blocks?

level 6 -----------------------------------(the "level X" line will be supressed from now on)
Sticky blocks stick at the thicker side.
When two blocks stick together, they form one single disconnected block!

7 Those two block pairs look trapped...
...but could they be moved?
How many sticky blocks do you need to free each trapped pair?
