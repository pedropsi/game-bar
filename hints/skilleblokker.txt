level 1 -----------------------------------(this is a hint group, composed of three hints, one per line)
Slide with the <kbd>arrow keys</kbd>.
Your goal is to split the blocks.
Try first pushing both blocks against a wall!

level 2 -----------------------------------(this is another hint group, with just 2 hints)
Every block pair must be split.
Sometimes, to move one step forward, you must first move backwards.
 


level 3 -----------------------------------(this hint group is separated from the previous one by more than one empty line)
Try preserving the level symmetry...
 
level 4 -----------------------------------(all numbers at the start of each hint line, below, are ignored)
4 The smaller blocks are trapped...
3 ... so where should you place the U-shaped blocks?

level 5 -----------------------------------
Contiguous blocks lodged against a wall can no longer be split...
... so which part of the L-shaped blocks may touch the wall safely?


level 6 -----------------------------------(the "level X" line will be supressed from now on)
Sticky blocks are thicker on the sticky side!
When two blocks stick together, they form one single block!

7 You can push multiple blocks.
How are the two trapped block pairs different?
How many sticky blocks can free each trapped pair?
Can you make a hook?
