# DOCUMENTATION:
#   acceptance/testconfig.txt controls when test files and test cases are
#   marked as expected failure and skip for a specific configuration.
#
#   testconfig.txt should only be used for permanent entries not due to bugs.
#   failconfig.txt should be used for all bugs.
#
#   the format for non-comment lines in this file is comma separated:
#   test, include config, exclude config, command, comments
#
# field descriptions:   
#
# test: a regular expression consisting of path to file relative from test/acceptance
#   The format is "filename:testcase name" where the : and testcase name are optional.
#   If a testcase name is not specified, then the command will apply to the entire test.
#
# include config & exclude config both are regexp to match the configuration
#   string with the format {CPU_ARCH}-{OS}-{VM}-{VERSION}-{VMSWITCH}
#
# all configs that match the include config and do not match the exclude 
#   config will apply to the command.
#
# commands are one of:
#   expectedfail - expects the test or testcase(s) to fail
#
#   The following commands only operate at a testfile level and not individual tests:
#
#   exclude - Do not compile and do not execute
#   ats_skip - don't generate an ATS swf as these files are not ATS compatible
#   deep - test should only run in deep phase for specified configs
#   skip - the test is not run, for example the configuration does not support
#          a feature or the file is not a test and is a helper file to another test
#   verify_skip - skip test when doing a verify run
#
# comments: please include bug reference and reason for the entry
